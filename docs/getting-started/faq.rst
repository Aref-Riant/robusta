Is Robusta a monitoring tool?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. It sits on top of your existing monitoring tools and adds insights and fixes.

For convenience, we've also created an all-in-one bundle with Robusta, Prometheus, AlertManager, and Grafana

How is this different from webhooks?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is powered by webhooks, but gives a higher-level abstraction.
