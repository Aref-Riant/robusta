Overview
======================

Robusta automates everything that happens **after** you deploy your application.

It is somewhat like Zapier/IFTTT for devops, with an emphasis on prebuilt automations and not just "build your own".

For example, the following automation sends logs to Slack when an alert fires for crashing pods:

.. code-block:: yaml

    triggers:
      - on_prometheus_alert:
          alert_name: KubePodCrashLooping
    actions:
      - logs_enricher: {}
    sinks:
      - slack

Every automation has three parts:

.. grid:: 3

    .. grid-item-card:: Triggers
        :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-bg-text-light
        :link: triggers/index
        :link-type: doc

        When to run
        (on alerts, logs, changes, etc)

    .. grid-item-card::  Actions
        :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-bg-text-light
        :link: actions/index
        :link-type: doc

        What to do
        (over 50 builtin actions)

    .. grid-item-card::  Sinks
        :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-bg-text-light
        :link: sinks/index
        :link-type: doc

        Where to send the result
        (Slack, etc)
